        <h1>Work Experience</h1>

        <h2>Regular full-time work (projects listed in reverse chronological order)</h2>

        <h3>Architect/Developer – BNY Mellon, November 1996 – Present</h3>
        <ul>

        <li><span class="project">SUI To BNY App Engine Migration</span> –
        The SUI application (see below), which was initially built as a
        subcomponent of a broader application (see Operational Desktop below), had to be broken out so it could run
        independently and then migrated from a dedicated-server WebSphere infrastructure to an internal cloud
        infrastructure running on Tomcat. This required a great deal of re-engineering and work with technologies
        including Docker, Kubernetes, ELK stack, Hazelcast, Vagrant, F5, and more, much of which I had to come up to
        speed on quickly and then mentor the rest of the team on throughout two-year-long effort. I was the lead
        architect on this effort in all fronts both technological and management-wise, directing a team of developers in
        various tasks throughout and providing valuable assistance to the project manager and business
        stakeholders.</li>

        <li><span class="project">SuRPAS User Interface (SUI)</span> –
        This was a multi-year project I was lead architect/developer/designer for and
        significantly contributed to business analysis, project management duties, resource acquisition and management
        and other non-technical tasks. This system was a ground-up redesign of a VB-based application, combined with a
        3270-based “green screen” application that replaced both and delivered significantly enhanced functionality and
        efficiencies for the business. This application consisted of hundreds of screens, a SOAP-based web service
        interface to a Unix-based system written in Fortran providing core business logic. This application was built
        with ExtJS talking to a Java-based app running on WebSphere via DWR, making SOAP-based web service calls to a
        Java-based service layer running in Tomcat, which then made low-level calls to the Fortran-based core system
        backed by a Faircom database.</li>

        <li><span class="project">Router Splitter Combiner (RSC)</span> –
        This was an application I inherited that took in data from multiple sources
        and performed manipulations on it, including splitting reports into separate data or combining them as defined
        by a web-based admin interface for defining configuration, all executed by a Java-based batch process.
        Transmissions were sent and received using NDM and triggered the execution of Bash scripts that then kicked off
        the Java processing. When I took this over, the project couldn’t even be built and tested by developers due to
        no documentation (or source code comments), no build script (it was being built inside an IDE only) and no test
        environment. I spent several weeks getting familiar with the codebase, writing documentation, putting together a
        build script and building a testing environment. I also performed some languishing but critical data cleanup
        tasks and rewrote the Bash scripts to handle things like DR exercises. I eventually handed this off to another
        team for ongoing development and support, at which point I spent quite a bit of time transferring knowledge and
        mentoring them before they were able to handle it on their own.</li>

        <li><span class="project">IIM</span> –
        This application was custom-built for a potential client and was essential in ultimately winning their
        business.I was involved in every aspect of this project, from requirements gathering to initial prototyping,
        interfacing with the client, designing the architecture and implementing the code. Primarily though, I served as
        technical manager and my efforts were instrumental in bringing the project in on time and successfully. This was
        built as a subcomponent of OPD, so the same technology used there was also used here.</li>

        <li><span class="project">eForms</span> –
        This application, which was a ground-up redesign of an aging and poorly-documented ASP-based
        application, was used to produce various types of client-facing documentation based on business-defined
        templates. Data was dynamically read from multiple remote systems via SOAP and REST-based web services and
        inserted into the HTML-based templates for eventual printing or downloading as a PDF. Enhanced functionality was
        introduced that lead to a higher degree of accuracy and speed in documentation creation for the business,
        yielding significant bottom-line benefits. This was built with many standard web technologies on the front-end
        and was backed by a Java-based back-end.</li>

        <li><span class="project">Fund Parameters</span> -
        This application’s function was to set up and maintain fund configuration information for
        the subaccounting line of business. It was a robust RIA utilizing ExtJS for front-end development and DWR for
        server-side communication with Java on the server. I served as the technical lead in charge of all aspects of
        application design, including UI, database, and batch processing design. I was an essential developer day-to-day
        as well as aiding in business analysis from start to finish. I oversaw a team of multiple developers while
        liaising with the business and analysis team to deliver this project successfully, making an exceedingly tight
        deadline that initially wasn’t even thought possible by stakeholders.</li>

        <li><span class="project">WebImage</span> -
        This application was a reimagining of a mission-critical VB-based imaging application as a
        Java-based RIA. It required extensive analysis and design to achieve desired efficiency gains as well as ensure
        that all existing functionality was still present while improving on areas where there were shortcomings in the
        existing application. Technologies employed include ExtJS, DWR, web services, and Snowbound imaging platform.
        This project was the first in our company to use an Agile methodology (SCRUM) and was a success in that regard
        and served as a model for other projects after that. My input played a significant role in deciding to pilot
        Agile in the first place as well as making it work. In my capacity as lead architect, I not only played a key
        development role but also oversaw the development team throughout via extensive mentoring.</li>

        <li><span class="project">Operational Desktop (OPD)</span> -
        This application was a very advanced RIA utilizing the cutting-edge web
        development techniques backed by a service-oriented architecture that aggregated numerous application “modules”
        into one integrated UI and back-end infrastructure. During this project, I defined standards that are now
        standards across the organization for RIA development, including usage of libraries such as Dojo, ActiveWidgets,
        ExtJS, and DWR, as well as guidelines for application architecture and UI construction. During this project, I
        focused primarily on UI development and usability. A big part of my job here was serving as a mentor to an
        approximately 15-person team as well as aiding in resource management decisions and setting overall project
        direction and designing the architecture.</li>

        <li><span class="project">Universal Transfer of Assets (UTOA)</span> –
        I was lead architect and developer of this Java-based application
        utilizing Struts and Oracle that tracked asset transfer requests. This system included complex print output
        utilizing a custom XML report template processor, an abstraction layer that allows for transparent communication
        with numerous back-end systems (mainframe-based and micro-based), J2EE security, and a very rich web-based GUI
        environment for end-users. This project involved contributing to business analysis, detailed specification
        writing and coordination of team members to implement those specifications, which I was responsible for
        producing.</li>

        <li><span class="project">IPAccess</span> -
        This was a high-traffic, mission-critical, mainframe-to-web integration system. This was a
        complete life-cycle effort involving extensive requirements and specifications documentation, team coordination,
        project management, quality assurance testing, and very advanced technological development (at the time) both
        client and server-side including early Ajax techniques, JavaScript, IWT, XML and a SOA approach to the core
        logic.</li>

        <li><span class="project">Complex Corporate Actions (CCA)</span> -
        This was a web-based application fronting CICS-based components that was
        the first mainframe-to-web project successfully completed at the time for processing complex investment holding
        modifications. I performed detailed business analysis, system design, and programming using a custom web
        framework as well as managed a team of developers to complete this critical initiative.</li>

        <li><span class="project">Payment System</span> –
        This was a Visual FoxPro-based application that replaced a completely manual, paper-based
        system for processing daily payments with a modern computer-based system. The ultimate result was a considerable
        cost saving for the company as well as a significant reduction in errors (some of which previously resulted in
        regulatory fines). While outdated by today’s standards, this application was unique at the time at the company
        in that it had a server-based component that coordinated data entry between hundreds of users, ensuring that
        duplicate work wasn’t occurring and also implementing a double-entry check system with automatic routing of
        work between users.</li>

        <li><span class="project">PowerImage Archive System (PIAS)</span> –
        I designed and implemented this VB and SQL Server-based document
        archiving system that saved the company in excess of $35k per month for several years by doing away with
        licensing of a vendor system it replaced. It included extensive search capabilities across a multi-terabyte
        database of images and even a rudimentary custom-built OCR subsystem for extracting metadata from images.</li>

        <li><span class="project">FPS Intranet</span> –
        I championed the creation of an Intranet in 1996, before Intranets were common, and won the
        backing of our management based on after-hours prototyping work showed them what was possible. I then
        independently designed and developed it, including an online purchase request system with routing and lifecycle
        management, HR documentation library, self-maintaining Novell Directory Service-based phone list, customizable
        portal home page, an online timesheet entry component, and workflow management tools.</li>

        <li><span class="project">NDS Phone List</span> –
        This was a small application I wrote that pulled information out of Novell Directory
        Services to produce an online phone directory for the company. This removed the need for assistants to maintain
        and distribute this information throughout the company manually. Originally written as a VB application, I then
        migrated it to a web-based technology stack that eventually became one of the first components hosted in the
        FPS Intranet.</li>

        </ul>
