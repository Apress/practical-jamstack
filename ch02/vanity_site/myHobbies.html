        <p>Yes, in addition to being a computer nerd, writer, husband, parent and all-around incredibly awesome person
        (continue reading once you stop laughing at me) I was a musician for a number of years. I was in a number of
        bands, chief among them was Cydonia. Although I haven't been in a band for some time and only play a little when
        the mood strikes me, it's a period in my life I'm proud of so I figured I'd share.</p>

        <div id="music" style="display:none;">
          <div class="heading">In The Beginning</div>
          <p>I began my musical "career", such as it is, when I was very young, maybe 6 or 7, when my grandparents gave
          me an old electronic organ. I remember it well: it was not much more than a very noisy fan that, when you
          pressed down on a key, would move a whistle of varying sizes in front of the fan to make the appropriate
          note.</p>

          <p>It was pure garbage, but I remember that, without any formal training whatsoever, how I would sit there
          and create a story with music. Usually, the story revolved around a woman and a man falling in love. I'd play
          a few random low notes, to represent the man talking, then the woman would reply with some random high notes.
          Like the organ itself, this was pure garbage! But, it began my love of creating music.</p>

          <p>The real first, important step was around 1985 when my best friend at the time, Jason Viglietta, began to
          take piano lessons. Around that time, he and I began tinkering with a crappy little Yamaha keyboard and his
          piano doing almost entirely improvised newage-type music. We'd literally sit there, he on keyboard and me on
          piano, or vice-versa, hit record on a tape deck, and just try and make something that didn't sound horrible.
          As you can guess, 99.9999% of the time, it indeed did sound horrible! But, over time we got to know each
          others' playing style (while at the same time actually learning how to play!) and it actually began to sound
          like something.</p>

          <p>I still had no formal training whatsoever, so I was always a "by-ear" musician (and that's true to this
          day). I simply learned, over time, what combinations of keys sounded good together, what notes could be played
          over others, etc. Eventually I did teach myself a little bit of theory, but even now, while I know some scales
          and chords, it's still not natural for me like for most musicians, and I still cannot read music!</p>

          <p>We decided to call ourselves ITSOD, an acronym for In the Shadows Of Dreams. Of course, having a pretty
          cool name (in my opinion anyway) was as far as we ever got.</p>

          <p>Jason and I eventually got pretty good, although we still were entirely improvisational, which means a
          couple of things. First, our recording sessions were just jam sessions that we recorded. Second, a lot of
          what we did still didn't work at all, although more and more did as we played together more. Third, when we
          did actually do something cool, it was often hard, sometimes pretty much impossible, to do it again! That
          made for trying to write an album, which we eventually tried to do, very difficult. It also means that there
          were A LOT of mistakes mixed in with the decent stuff.

          <div class="heading">The Cydonia Years</div>
          <p>For a while after I got back from my stint in the military, I bounced around between a couple of different
          bands. None you'd know, none of any note, but they were valuable experiences because it was the first time,
          aside from two minor instances my senior year of high school, that I was in a real, working (to some
          approximation of the word "working"!) band.</p>

          <p>After that free-agency period though I settled down, as it were, with a couple of guys from Brooklyn,
          Jason Donnelly and Dimitri "Duke" Borisov. Jason is a guitarist and Duke is a drummer. They had worked
          together before and were looking for a couple of band mates at the same time I was. A few ads in the
          Island Ear and a phone call or two later and we hooked up to form the band Cydonia.</p>

          <p>Initially it was just the three of us, but we eventually hooked up with a singer named Anthony (I don't
          recall his last name). Before long, we began to record an album and about this time we started playing live
          gigs, which is one of the highlights of my life! If you've never been on stage in front of 100+ people
          cheering for you, lemme tell you, it's something special! We always got great crowd reactions because we were
          nearly always obviously better than the other bands on that night, and we usually closed the night out because
          the club owners knew we were going to seal the deal strong. Now, interestingly, we dumped Anthony before we
          started playing out, which is part of the reason we were well-received! (I don't mean to bash Anthony because
          he was a real good guy and got us free food as Taco Bell where he worked, it's just that he really wasn't a
          great singer.) In order to play out we need a singer though, and we found a temporary fix by the name of
          John Henry, a friend of Jeremy. He was pretty good, but was off doing his own band thing, so it was always
          just temporary. In fact, if you want to have a look at him, along with the rest of us and a lot of weird
          stuff, check out our web site for the early years! Incidentally, this is also one of the very first web site
          I ever made (umm, and it seriously shows!) Surprisingly, the guestbook seems to still be out there!
          WOO-HOO!</p>

          <p>Eventually, we found a good, permanent singer by the name of James (who's last name again I don't recall!).
          He was quite a bit better, although the recordings here don't quite demonstrate how good he actually was
          (there's unfortunately a lot of audio artifacts from having been transferred between various tapes over the
          years). Unfortunately, he had some personal issues that would eventually contribute to the downfall of the
          band, but regardless, he was a good singer and we made beautiful music together, as the saying goes!</p>

          <p>The good news is that Jason, who it the godfather of my son, is still one of my best friends, and both
          Jeremy and Duke and I still talk every now and again too. We've even made jokes over the years about an
          "inevitable Cydonia reunion", so you never know ;) In any case, I'm proud of the few songs we did, I thought
          we had a real chance as a band and I have a lot of happy memories from that period in my life.</p>

          to a quick video I recorded on YouTube. It's just a couple minutes of random jamming with my Korg Krome, which
          I had recently gotten at the time I recorded this.</p>

          <div class="heading">In Conclusion</div>
          <p>So, there you have it: an almost superstar musician :) Look, we were never going to be Bon Jovi and I was
          never going to be Rick Wakeman, but I had a lot of fun and I think produced some decent tunes. You can be the
          judge of course, but just remember: whatever you think is wrong and I'm right :)</p>

          <h3>Book I of The Infinite Universe Saga</h3>
          <p>When light gives way to darkness, only terror remains!</p>
          <p>An unfathomably advanced alien technology slowly gains sentience over thousands of years roaming the galaxy
          on a secret, ancient and malevolent mission.</p>
          <p>The first test of a new military "hyperstealth" system, based on technology and physics theories far beyond
          anything previously dreamed of, irrevocably changes the course of humanity's future, opening doors that would
          better remain closed.</p>
          <p>And at the intersection of these events is husband and wife team Alex and Melissa Wakeman, the very
          definition of a "power couple": Alex a veteran special military operator turned Air Force test pilot who likes
          to keep things light with humor but who is highly capable in any situation; Melissa a world-class scientific
          mind, perhaps the smartest person on Earth in fact, specializing in advanced military aircraft design.</p>
          <p>They, along with their superior and friend Brendan Alcheck, wage an apocalyptic battle against a horrific
          alien hybrid, born of death and decidedly deadlier than any creature on Earth. Together, they must race
          against time to stop the creature from completing its mission: the return of the hyperstealth technology to
          its masters, a highly advanced malevolent race who, unbeknownst to the human race, sow death and destruction
          throughout the galaxy. Unimaginable sacrifices are made and a final, impossible battle fought on multiple
          fronts will determine the fate of the human race, and that of thousands of as yet unknown species.</p>
          <p>The Darkness Beyond the Light, book I of the Infinite Universe Saga, is a tense, action-packed sci-fi
          thriller, an adventure you will not want to miss!</p>

            onclick="window.location='https://zammetti.com/booksarticles/alternate_realities.htm';">Alternate Realities</a>
          <p>You know, most people would bury this sort of horrid, early writing and just pretend it never existed. But
          I'm not most people :) I'm a glutton for punishment it seems! This story is very much like The Darkness Beyond
          the Light in that I wrote it around the age of 16 or so and it's a similar creation in that it's a terrible,
          awful, teen-angsty sci-fi/fantasy ode to young love. Worse still, I don't even know what girlfriend was in my
          life at the time I wrote this! Also like that other story, this was scanned in from an old (hand-written this
          time) stack of papers and run through OCR. So, I did a very minimal amount of cleanup without altering the
          story, poor word choices, clumsy writing or anything else aside from fixing obvious errors caused by the OCR
          process itself. So it's still loaded with errors, totally illogical and frankly stupid plot points... you
          know, where there actually IS a plot anyway... and all manner of other disgustingly bad stuff... so, when I
          say it's unadulterated crap you know I'm not kidding! But, it again represents a part of my history so what
          the hell, here it is world!</p>

            onclick="window.location='https://zammetti.com/booksarticles/the_darkness_beyond_the_light.htm';">The Darkness Beyond the Light (Old Short Story)</a>
          <p>Note that this is completely different from The Darkness Beyond the Night novel above! Yes, I recycled the
          name, sue me! :)</p>

          <p>This is a short story I wrote when I was about 16-17 and discovering love for the first time. It's a sappy,
          sci-fi/new-age mish-mosh about ancient aliens battling through time, evil ruling the universe and how two
          humans overcome it through the power of love. Yes, it's about as corny as that makes it sound! But hey, I was
          young and experiencing many things for the first time, so sue me! This was OCR'd from an old printout I
          happened upon one day. I've done some editing of it to try and correct as much grammar and spelling and OCR
          errors as I can but (a) I didn't change anything of substance, for good or bad, and (b) there's still a lot of
          problems that you'll notice it you're a grammar-police type. There's also ample plot holes, contradictions,
          plot threads that never get paid off, plot twists that are AT BEST huge logical stretches, things happening
          for no apparent reason and just flat-out stupid stuff. But I left all that in so it's as accurate a
          reproduction of the original material as it can be. Make no mistake, this is pretty bad writing (and I
          certainly hope not representative of my current writing ability!), but hey, it's part of my history, so if
          you're so inclined, check it out... but you were warned!</p>
